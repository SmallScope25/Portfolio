# Game Portfolio Curation - IP-Protected Showcase

## IP Protection Framework

### 🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT: ALL PROJECTS ARE IN FLUID DEVELOPMENT

**Game design is iterative, not linear.** GDDs are guides, not final decisions. Mechanics evolve during development.

**Portfolio Strategy:**
- ✅ **Show solid visuals** (character designs, environments, art direction)
- ✅ **Frame as "concept development"** (honest about stage)
- ❌ **Don't claim finality** (mechanics may change during build phase)
- ✅ **Demonstrate design thinking** (exploration, iteration, problem-solving)

**This approach:**
- Shows your creative output and skills
- Doesn't lock you into specific mechanics before they're tested
- Honest about pre-production stage (normal for game dev)
- Leaves room for evolution and improvement
- Protects unique mechanics until you have execution proof

---

### Three-Tier Disclosure Model

**🌐 TIER 1: PUBLIC PORTFOLIO** (What anyone can see on website)
- ✅ Visual designs (character art, environments, UI mockups)
- ✅ High-level premise (1-2 sentence elevator pitch, vague on mechanics)
- ✅ Technical skills demonstrated (Unity, Godot, Blender, ML-Agents)
- ✅ Design process (wireframes, iterations, problem-solving)
- ✅ "Concept development" framing (honest about pre-production stage)
- ✅ Character roster (names + visual style, no story/mechanic secrets)
- ✅ Design challenges being explored (shows thinking without revealing solutions)

**🤝 TIER 2: INTERVIEW/NDA** (What you show in person/video call)
- ⚠️ Deeper mechanics (how systems interact, core loops - still high level)
- ⚠️ Narrative samples (story beats, character arcs - not full plot)
- ⚠️ Production pipeline (asset management, workflows, timelines)
- ⚠️ Playable prototypes (if available)
- ⚠️ Design explorations (what you're testing, not final decisions)

**🔒 TIER 3: PRIVATE** (Never share publicly, even under NDA until deal/employment)
- 🔒 Unique core mechanics (the "secret sauce" that makes your game special)
- 🔒 Proprietary formulas (progression math, balancing, economy)
- 🔒 Specific narrative hooks (plot twists, romance reveals, emotional payoffs)
- 🔒 Exact progression systems (how players advance, unlock, grow)
- 🔒 Monetization strategies (pricing, retention mechanics, F2P hooks)
- 🔒 Source code (full implementation details)
- 🔒 Complete GDDs with all mechanics revealed
- 🔒 Marketing research (competitive analysis, target demographics)

## Portfolio Strategy for Fluid Development Projects

### Game Design Is Iterative, Not Linear

**Reality of game development:**
- ✅ **GDDs are guides, not gospel** - Mechanics evolve during build phase
- ✅ **"Near finalized" becomes "drastically changed"** - Normal when actual building starts
- ✅ **Core concepts persist, details flex** - Theme/vibe remains, systems adapt
- ✅ **Pre-production explores possibilities** - Testing ideas before committing

**Your approach:**
> "The basic concept will persist (waiting as gameplay for EQ, microscopic scale for Re:Mote), but specific mechanics and systems are deliberately fluid until testing validates them."

**This is PROFESSIONAL game dev thinking.**

---

### Framing "Concept Development" Positively

**❌ AVOID (Sounds apologetic):**
- "Still working on the GDD"
- "Not finished yet"
- "Just a concept"
- "Nowhere near complete"
- "The GDD isn't set in stone"

**✅ USE (Sounds professional):**
- "Concept development - [233 character designs] complete, mechanics under exploration"
- "Pre-production phase - art direction finalized, gameplay systems in iterative testing"
- "Core design established, implementation details being refined through prototyping"
- "Visual development complete, mechanical systems in active development"
- "Exploring [design challenge] through iterative prototyping"

**What this framing does:**
- ✅ Shows substantial progress (assets, designs, technical work)
- ✅ Honest about stage without sounding uncertain
- ✅ Demonstrates iterative design thinking (industry standard)
- ✅ Leaves room for evolution (smart, not indecisive)
- ✅ Focuses on what's DONE rather than what's "not finished"

# GAME 1: EN QUEUE (EQ)

## Project Overview
**Genre:** Waiting Simulator / Hidden Romance / Narrative Experiment
**Status:** Concept Development - 233+ character designs complete, core mechanic designed, gameplay systems in exploration
**Key Stats:** 233 image files (character designs + environments), 3D assets (FBX/Blend files), organized GDD structure
**Your Favorite:** Personal passion project with unique emotional hook
**⚠️ IP WARNING:** EXTREMELY UNIQUE CORE MECHANIC - Maximum protection required

## 🔒 CORE MECHANIC (TIER 3 - NEVER SHARE PUBLICLY)

### The "Line Position = Progression" System (KEEP ABSOLUTELY SECRET)

**Revolutionary Design (Commercial Gold):**
- **No base/hideout/load screen** - All game systems integrated into waiting line environment
- **Line position = progression levels** - Back of line = Level 1, forward positions = higher levels
- **"Zoning out" = battle trigger** - Daydreaming/spacing out enters imaginary battle sequences
- **Progression rules:**
  - ✅ Complete stage/battle = move forward in line (level up)
  - ⚠️ Get "knocked awake" (lose focus) = stay in same position
  - ❌ Get killed/lose all HP = move back to end of line
- **Environmental game systems (integrated into waiting):**
  - Public restroom = safe space
  - Water cooler/fountain = healing/resource management
  - Vending machine = item shop
  - Roaming salesperson = rare/epic item vendor
  - Queue position = save state representation
- **Battle environments:** Themed by the business you're waiting in
  - Coffee shop → caffeine-fueled dreams
  - DMV → bureaucratic nightmares
  - Bank → financial anxiety sequences
  - Mechanic shop → mechanical/industrial imagination
  - Deli, doctor's office, etc. → endless "places we all wait"
- **Risk/reward:** Do you zone out for battles/rewards (risk position) or stay present (safe but slower)?
- **Difficulty settings:** Permadeath vs. incremental saves (still exploring)

**Why This Must Stay Secret:**
1. **Never been done** - Line position as literal progression is novel
2. **Thematically perfect** - Everything coheres around "waiting"
3. **Infinitely expandable** - Any "place we wait" becomes a level
4. **Easy to steal** - Concept is clear enough to clone if revealed
5. **Indie game festival potential** - This is awards-worthy if executed well

**DO NOT REVEAL THIS MECHANIC IN:**
- Portfolio website
- Social media
- Casual conversations
- Interviews without NDA
- GDD excerpts
- Public presentations

**Only discuss after:**
- NDA signed, OR
- Playable demo exists (harder to steal with execution proof), OR
- Ready to commit to full development and launch

# GAME 4: RE:MOTE (RM) + RE:MOTE MOBILE (RMM)

## Project Overview
**Genre:** Iso/Open World Soulslike at Microscopic Scale
**Status:** Pre-production - Character concepts ready, extensive planning complete
**Key Stats:** Two-version concept (PC/Console + Mobile pseudo-AR), physics-based educational angle
**Platforms:** PC/Console (Re:Mote) + Mobile (Re:Mote Mobile with room-scan AR)
**⚠️ IP WARNING:** HIGHLY UNIQUE CONCEPT - Extreme caution on public disclosure

## 🔒 PRIVATE CONCEPT OVERVIEW (DO NOT SHARE PUBLICLY)

### Full Premise (Keep Confidential)
**Re:Mote (Core Game):**
- Player is a dust particle starting at molecular scale
- Environment: One-bedroom apartment → grows with human companion's life progression
- Companion human: College years → first job → life changes
- Player progression: Molecular speck → dust ball (size-based leveling)
- Gameplay: Iso/open world soulslike with boss battles around apartment
- Voyeuristic observation: Human's movements become environmental hazards/puzzles
- Difficulty scaling: Pets, guests, human activities increase challenge
- Narrative: Companion's life changes parallel player's growth and unlock new areas (moving boxes → new apartments/houses)
- Educational angle: Realistic physics properties as potential selling point

**Re:Mote Mobile (RMM):**
- Pseudo-AR room scanning technology
- PCG math applied to real-world room scans
- Creates playable microscopic environment from YOUR actual room
- Inspiration: IKEA Place, Amazon AR, architecture scanning, astronomy constellation apps
- Shared technology development with BCT pseudo-AR concepts
- Mass-market mobile appeal with personalized gameplay

### Why This Concept Must Stay Private
- **Unique protagonist scale** - Dust particle POV is commercially novel
- **Human companion parallel growth** - Core narrative hook with emotional resonance
- **Room scan → microscopic world** - Technical implementation is competitive advantage
- **Educational physics angle** - Adds legitimacy and market differentiation
- **Dual-version strategy** - Premium game + mobile AR is smart positioning

## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY FOR RE:MOTE

### ❌ RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT INCLUDE IN PUBLIC PORTFOLIO YET

**Reasons to Wait:**
1. **Concept is TOO unique** - High theft risk before protection/launch
2. **Incomplete execution** - No assets to show strength without revealing concept
3. **Better served by NDA discussion** - This is an interview conversation piece, not portfolio piece
4. **Focus on proven work first** - EQ (characters ready), BCT (assets ready), GTDB (active)

### ✅ ALTERNATIVE: Private Portfolio Piece

**For Trusted Interviews Only:**
- Create separate Re:Mote deck (PDF, password-protected)
- Share only after NDA signed or with trusted contacts
- Use as "I have additional projects I can discuss under NDA" teaser
- Leverage as conversation starter without revealing details

### 🎯 When to Go Public with Re:Mote

**Wait until:**
- [ ] Playable prototype exists (harder to steal with execution proof)
- [ ] IP protection researched (trademark, copyright considerations)
- [ ] Enough assets exist to showcase without over-explaining
- [ ] Other portfolio pieces (EQ, BCT, GTDB) are live and polished
- [ ] You're ready to commit to development (not just concept stage)

## SCIENCE/PHYSICS RESEARCH NOTES

### Educational Angle Potential
- Realistic dust particle physics (size, weight, movement)
- Microscopic scale environmental interactions
- Electrostatic forces, air currents, surface adhesion
- Educational game market appeal (schools, science education)

### Research Needed
- [ ] Consult physics resources or "science agent" for realistic mechanics
- [ ] Balance realism vs. fun (don't make it tedious simulation)
- [ ] Identify which physics properties add gameplay value
- [ ] Research educational game market for positioning

### Reference Apps for Pseudo-AR Tech
- IKEA Place (furniture placement AR)
- Amazon AR View (product visualization)
- Architecture scanning apps (room geometry capture)
- Astronomy apps (constellation mapping, sky overlay)
- Research how these implement room scanning → usable geometry

---

## STRATEGIC PRIORITY: FOCUS ON EQ + BCT FIRST

**User is correct:** Re:Mote is too unique and incomplete for public portfolio right now.

**Better strategy:**
1. **Public portfolio:** EQ (characters), BCT (Unity assets), GTDB (active project)
2. **Private discussions:** Re:Mote as "I have additional concepts we can discuss under NDA"
3. **Development focus:** Get EQ or BCT to playable state first
4. **Re:Mote development:** Prototype in private, reveal when ready

**This protects your IP while still showing depth to interested parties.**

- Show range: card game + action + narrative experiment
- Demonstrate technical skills across engines (Godot + Unity)

## Phase 2: Selective Expansion (NEXT)
Add depth carefully:

4. **GTS** - 597MB IG-validated art, NieR inspiration, 3 POV system
   - **Caution:** Don't over-reveal narrative structure
   - Focus on visual style and character designs

## Phase 3: Private/Future Projects (HOLD)
Projects to withhold from public portfolio for now:

5. **RE:MOTE (RM/RMM)** - ❌ **DO NOT INCLUDE IN PUBLIC PORTFOLIO YET**
   - **Reason:** Concept is TOO unique, high theft risk
   - **Strategy:** Use as NDA-protected interview piece only
   - **When to show:** After playable prototype exists or IP protection secured
   - **Current use:** "I have additional projects we can discuss under NDA"

## Phase 4: Polish & Iteration (ONGOING)
Improve existing public portfolio:

- Add playable prototypes as developed
- Update with new concept art
- Expand GDD excerpts (carefully, never over-reveal)
- Document development progress
- Build Re:Mote in private until ready for public disclosure

## IP PROTECTION STRATEGIC SUMMARY

### ✅ Safe to Show Publicly (Low Theft Risk)
- **GTDB** - Steam deckbuilder concept is unique enough with Leonardo AI angle
- **BCT** - Pseudo-AR shmup with ML-Agents (technical execution is the moat)
- **EQ** - Waiting game with hidden romance (execution matters more than premise)
- **GTS** - 3 POV action RPG (genre convention, visual style is the differentiator)

### 🔒 Keep Private Until Protected (High Theft Risk)
- **RE:MOTE** - Dust particle protagonist, human companion growth, room-scan AR
  - This is COMMERCIALLY VIABLE and HIGHLY UNIQUE
  - Easy to steal if over-explained before execution proof exists
  - Better as portfolio conversation piece ("I have an unannounced project...")

### 🎯 Portfolio Positioning Strategy

**Public message:**
"I have multiple game projects in various stages of development. Some are ready to showcase, others I'm happy to discuss under NDA."

**This approach:**
- Shows depth (you have MORE than what's shown)
- Protects valuable IP (Re:Mote stays secret)
- Creates intrigue (what's the NDA project?)
- Demonstrates professionalism (you understand IP protection)

# NEXT STEPS

## Immediate Actions

1. **Asset Audit** - Verify what exists in project folders:
   - [ ] EQ: Count character designs, identify hero images
   - [ ] BCT: Review 936MB assets, find showcase-worthy pieces
   - [ ] GTS: Review 597MB IG art, select portfolio pieces
   - [ ] RM: Verify character concepts, pipeline examples
   - [ ] GTDB: Check GTDB folder for scenes/cards/mockups

2. **Create Missing Assets** (prioritize GTDB, BCT, EQ):
   - [ ] Hero images (1 per game)
   - [ ] Character lineup grids (4-8 characters)
   - [ ] GDD excerpts (High Concept + 1 safe section)

3. **Write Copy**:
   - [ ] Elevator pitches (already drafted above - refine)
   - [ ] Design challenge writeups (1 paragraph each)
   - [ ] "What I Learned" sections (honest, growth-focused)

4. **Build Game Project Pages** (HTML/CSS):
   - [ ] Start with GTDB (most active, most ready)
   - [ ] Then BCT (Unity screenshots ready)
   - [ ] Then EQ (unique hook, personal favorite)

# FOLDER STRUCTURE CHECK

**Verify these folders exist and document contents:**

- [ ] `OttoBuildStudio/GameBuilder/GTDB/` - Godot project, what's built?
- [ ] `OneDrive/SmallScope/Game Concepts/EQ/` - Character designs, how many?
- [ ] `OneDrive/SmallScope/Game Concepts/GTS/` - 597MB art, what's there?
- [ ] `OneDrive/SmallScope/Game Concepts/BCT/` - Or Unity project folder?
- [ ] `OneDrive/SmallScope/Game Concepts/RM/` - Character concepts, count?

**Document in this file once verified.**

## PROJECT CARDS NARRATIVE STRATEGY

**For Entry-Level Applicant with No Professional Experience:**

The three project cards create a powerful story about range and learning:

| Project | Learning Type | Strength | Skills Demonstrated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wayfarer | Structured (DesignLabs) | Design fundamentals | UI/UX, visual design, design systems |
| RX Manager | Self-taught | Problem-solving + implementation | Full-stack, mobile dev, user needs |
| BCT Unity | Self-taught | Technical depth | Game engines, AI integration, systems architecture |

**Key Message**: "I learn both formally AND independently. I design AND code. I solve real problems."

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Design fundamentals (Wayfarer coursework)
- ✅ Technical implementation (RX Manager, Unity)
- ✅ Problem-solving for real needs (girlfriend's medication management)
- ✅ Self-directed learning (Unity ML-Agents, custom AI systems)
- ✅ Range (design + mobile + game dev)
- ✅ Daily growth mindset (active learning, certifications in progress)

**Honest Positioning:**
- Wayfarer: "DesignLabs Foundations coursework" (own it, shows structured education)
- RX Manager: "Self-taught project" (proves independent execution)
- BCT: "Learning project" (shows technical ambition, not production-ready)

**No Apologies Needed**: Entry-level employers expect rough edges. What matters is proof of learning, building, and solving.

## GEMINI BLIND PANEL FEEDBACK (Feb 2026)

### Overall Assessment
**Verdict**: "Powerhouse collection with cohesive visual language. Master of Digital Puppetry."

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Too Character-Focused** - Need more "system thinking" for Creative Technologist roles
2. **Repetition Problem** - Eject (14) appears in landing + creative (shrinks perceived portfolio)
3. **Architecture Gap** - Missing environmental/spatial design proof for game studios
4. **Tech Gap** - Need process imagery showing iteration/systematic thinking

### Key Recommendations Implemented
- Landing slot 5: WumpWear (2) → (13) for asset design proof
- Eject creative: Removed (14) repetition, swapped for (18)
- Art Gallery slot 7: ShamPhoto (2) for environmental storytelling
- Art Gallery slot 8: SirKit (52) for lighting mastery
- Better balance: 2 character + 2 architecture + 1 product + 3 atmosphere

### Entry-Level Positioning Strategy
**Context**: No professional experience, working on certifications, broad role targeting

**What This Portfolio Must Prove**:
1. **Range** - Not just character design (characters + environments + products + systems)
2. **Systematic Thinking** - Process, iteration, classification (WumpWear grid, asset design)
3. **Technical Fundamentals** - Composition, color theory, spatial design, lighting
4. **AI Mastery** - Bending AI to specific aesthetic will, not just "lucky prompts"

**Missing Piece** (Future Addition):
- WumpWear (18) or similar - Grid of variations showing data sets/systematic iteration
- Consider adding to "How I Build" pipeline section or as gallery slot
